This repo contains the main program loop for a color-sensing cart constructed with a team for an introductory mechatronics course. The cart steers and controls based on sensed obstacles and received color light.

A demo of the cart can be found on a team member's youtube page at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDuFc_5hlQk
